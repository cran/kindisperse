#' Calculate the intergenerational (PO) dispersal kernel from the distributions of close kin
#'
#' This function takes (at least) two vectors of kinship dispersal distances from defined kinship categories, and returns a resulting calculation of the parent-offspring
#' (intergenerational) kinship dispersal kernel. Dispersal distances can be inputted as numeric vectors, or alternatively as objects of classes \code{\link{KinPairData}}
#' or \code{\link{KinPairSimulation}}.
#'
#' This (with its paired function \code{\link{axpermute_standard}}) are the core functions implemented in the \code{kindisperse} package. They enable the decomposition of the
#' pedigree & dispersal information contained in the sampled distributions of close kin dyads (full siblings, first cousins, etc.) & its leveraging within an additive dispersal
#' framework to estimate the key intergenerational (parent-offspring) dispersal parameter of a population. Four key ideas underpin the approach in this function: (a) tracing
#' dispersal pedigrees to determine the number of complete intergenerational (breeding-cycle-spanning) dispersal events separating the sampled close-kin dyads; (b) using kin categories
#' that share the same overarching kinship 'phase' to control for residual 'phased' (non-intergenerational) disperal events that occur at the pedigree branch point (e.g. ovipositional
#' dispersal for full sibling mosquitoes), and (c) using synced or equivalent sampling points to eliminate non-intergenerational dispersal at the branch-tips of the pedigrees, then
#' finally (d) decomposing the 'pure' pedigree-associated (intergenerational) dispersal into an estimae of the single-generation intergenerational dispersal parameter.
#'
#' At its most basic, this function requires information about two dispersal vectors, a & b - both of a phased kinship category, & \code{vector a} having a more dispersed pedigree
#' than \code{vector b}. In addition to this initial pair of dispersed kin categories, either one or another matched pair of kin categories can be added:
#'
#' 1. A mixture category. This redefines the vector it is paired with (either a or b) so that rather than being considered as a 'pure' pedigree variant, it is considered as mixed with a
#' different kin category, often of a differing pedigree phase. If used, the other initial vector must also be paired with a related mixture category or composite vector.
#'
#' 2. A composite dispersal vector. This is defined exactly as the initial dispersal vectors. After calculation, the axial value found is composited with that of the matched initial vector, and
#' its kinship category redefined as a mixture category as above. If used, the other initial vector must also be paired with a related mixture category or composite vector. These can be paired so
#' that a mixture category (e.g. first & half-first cousins where these could not be separated with available genetic data) can be counterbalanced with the composition of full sibling & half-sibling
#' dyads, which (assuming equal mixture) approximately controls for the phasing of the mixed kin categories, enabling an estimate of intergenerational dispersal without exact knowledge of the
#' composition of the cousins distribution.
#'
#' Each vector or \code{KinPairData} / \code{KinPairSimulation} object is paired with several other parameters: (1) a logical (e.g. \code{amix} delineating whether the category is being
#' used in the calculation, (2) a category parameter (.e.g \code{acat}) defining what kin relationship is being measured, (3) an optional breeding cycle number (e.g. \code{acycle})
#' showing the number of breeding cycles each member of the kin pair has passed through before being sampled (the cycle vector \code{c(1, 0)} corresponds to an adult & a juvenile
#' being sampled at the same point in the breeding cycle; \code{c(1, 1)} represents two adults (i.e. after their first breeding), etc.) . If a \code{\link{KinPairData}} or
#' \code{\link{KinPairSimulation}} object is inputted, all paired parameters that are not explicitly set will default to those contained in the objects (using KinPair objects
#' is the ideal way to deploy this function).

#' limited intergenerational dispersal in the yellow fever mosquito", \doi{10.1111/1755-0998.13043}.
