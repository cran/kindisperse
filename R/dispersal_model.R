#' Create Dispersal Model of an Organism
#'
#' The function creates an object of class \code{DispersalModel} carrying organism-specific information about dispersal stages (with axial
#' sigmas), FS & HS branch points, and the dispersal stage at which sampling occurs.It is used with the
#' \code{\link{simulate_kindist_custom}} function to enable the simulation of uniquely defined breeding & dispersal cycles.
#'
#' The original simulation functions in this package (\code{simulate_kindist_simple()} & \code{simulate_kindist_composite}) were
#' designed for an organism with a specific (& relatively simple) breeding & dispersal cycle. 'simple' corresponded to a single
#' dispersal event across a lifespan, equivalency of all dispersal phases (FS, HS, PO) and no lifetime overlaps. 'composite'
#' corresponded to many insect dispersal situations, where breeding & oviposition are the key 'phase-defining' events (i.e.,
#' they lead to the initial gamete dispersal of half siblings & full siblings from each other), where field sampling typically
#' occurs via ovitraps
#'
#' More general dispersal scenarios (e.g in mammals) require the ability to uniquely specify a variety of distinct breeding
#' ecologies & sampling schemes: the \code{\link{DispersalModel}} class paired with the \code{\link{simulate_kindist_custom}}
#' function achieves this by defining a breeding cycle with an arbitrary number of dispersal phases (the \code{dispersal_vector}
#' slot, accessed by the \code{\link{dispersal_vector}} method).
#'
#' The breeding structure of a species may also impact at which stage
#' FS and HS phase branches occur. In \emph{Ae. aegypti}, males mate with multiple females in a (single) breeding season, and a female
#' typically carried the egg of only one male. In this context the FS (full-sibling) phase would be set to correspond to the female's
#' oviposition dispersal, while the HS (half-sibling) phase would be set to correspond to the male's breeding dispersal (as its gametes
#' will then be dispersed by multiple females across their gravid & ovipositional phases). However, in e.g. some species of the marsupial
#' \emph{Antechinus}, the FS branch point would be more appropriately associated with juveniles at the time that they leave the mother's
#' pouch. The \code{.FS} and \code{.HS} parameters enable the assignment of these phase branches to any
#' defined life phase. Similarly, the \code{.sampling_stage} parameter allow the sampling point to be set to correspond to any
#' phase of the defined breeding cycle (this is later accessed with the \code{\link{sampling_stage}} method).
#'
#' The final parameter stored in this object is the breeding cycle number \code{.cycle}, accessed later by the \code{\link{breeding_cycle}} method.
#' This parameter enables the treatment of species that undergo multiple breeding cycles in one lifetime. This is defined as a length two
#' vector describing the number of breeding cycles undergone by the final descendant of branch 1 and branch 2 of the dispersal pedigree before
#' their sampling. (where branch one is the 'senior' and branch two the 'junior' member of the pedigree) (so uncle is branch one, nephew branch
#' two, grandmother branch one, granddaughter branch two, etc.). For each member of the resulting kin pair, the cycle number represents the
#' number of complete breeding cycles each individual has undergone before the sampling point, where the time between birth and first
#' reproduction is coded as '0', that between first and second reproduction '1', etc. This enables an application of the simulation
#' functions defined here to deal with populations with some amount of overlap between generations.
#'
#' Note that this 'breeding cycle' approach is only applicable in situations where there is an approximate equivalence between the dispersal which
#' occurs in the first 'juvenile' breeding cycle and that which occurs between later breeding cycles. This parameter is implemented here, but it
#' will often be more productive to implement it instead as a parameter of the \code{\link{simulate_kindist_custom}} function (the cycle parameter
#' there if set overrides whatever was defined within this object)
#'
#' @param ... name, value (numeric) pairs pairing custom lifestages with their corresponding axial dispersal values. MUST
#' be in chronological order across the entire breeding cycle.
#' @param .FS (character) - breeding cycle stage at which first substantial FS-phased dispersal occurs. Must correspond to a
#' previously described cycle stage name. Typically reflects the first dispersal of female gametes from the mother at (variously)
#' egg-laying, birth, weaning stages (species-dependent). Use care in adapting to situations where multiple breeding and/or dispersal
#' routes commonly lead to the FS phase
#' @param .HS (character) - breeding cycle stage at which first substantial HS-phased dispersal occurs. Must correspond to a
#' previously described cycle stage name. Typically reflects the movement of male gametes at e.g. the breeding stage (use care in adapting
#' to situations where multiple dispersal routes commonly lead to the HS phase)
#' @param .sampling_stage (character) - stage in the breeding cycle at which samples are to be collected for kin identification. Must correspond
#' to a previously described cycle stage name. (so collection of eggs corresponds to an egg-laying stage, as juveniles to a juvenile stage, etc.)
#' @param .cycle (integer >= -1 or vector of two such integers) breeding cycle numbers of dispersed kin to be modeled. Represents
#' the number of complete breeding cycles each simulated individual has undergone before the sampling point, where the time between
#' first dispersal and first reproduction is coded as '0', that between first and second reproduction '1', etc. (default 0). If .cycle
#' is specially set to '-1' this constitutes the sampling of an individual before it has differentiated (via dispersal) from the parent. Only use in spp.
#' where there is likely to be a reasonable equivalence between breeding stages across a lifespan. As the rest of the model is compatible
#' with a variety of cycle points, this parameter will often be overridden by the 'cycle' parameter in the \code{simulate_kindist_custom} function.
#' @param .breeding_stage (character) - stage in the cycle at which breeding occurs. Must correspond to a previously described cycle
#' stage name. By default, equated with the .HS stage. This stage corresponds to the \strong{generation} of next-generation individuals;
#' the .FS & .HS stages correspond to their separation. Needed for situations where individuals are sampled before they separate from the parent.
#' Modify if the modeled .HS gamete dispersal event does not correspond to the initial breeding event.
#' @param .visible_stage (character) - stage in the cycle at the \strong{beginning} of which individuals are visible to the study for
#' sampling rather than their parents (i.e. the beginning point of \code{cycle 0}). By default, equated with the .FS stage. This parameter
#' determines how many dispersal stages individuals have gone through before they are sampled - if \code{.sampling_stage} occurs just
#' \strong{after} \code{.visible_stage}, the sampled individuals will have dispersed through only a small amount of the breeding cycle. if
#' \code{.sampling_stage} occurs just \strong{before} \code{.visible_stage}, the sampled individuals will have dispersed throughout most
#' of the breeding cycle before being sampled. If \code{.cycle} is set to \code{-1}, dispersal stages between breeding & visibility
#' can be accessed.

#' can be passed to simulation functions.
