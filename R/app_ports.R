#' Mount \code{KinPairData} Objects for use in kindisperse app
#'
#' @description This function is part of a suite of functions handling the interface between the kindisperse app & R
#' package. Due to how shiny's interactive programming works, ordinary objects are not visible to the reactive functions
#' embedded in the app. The solution implemented here is to construct a custom environment, \code{env_appdata}, that is
#' accessible within the app and outside of it.
#'
#' This function takes an object of class \code{KinPairData} or \code{KinPairSimulation}, assigns it an identifying name,
#' and adds it to the app interface environment, making it accessible within the app. Once added, this object will be
#' accessible under its name from the \code{Load} menue of the app. (The app interface uses the same function
#' internally, enabling objects to be passed to the interface from the app also).
#' @param x An object of class \code{KinPairData} or {KinPairSimulation}
#' @param nm character. A name to store the object as
